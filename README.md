# Tulane Emergency Medical Services Diversity Survey

This repository holds the materials of a preliminary analysis of the 2023 Tulane Emergency Medical Services Diversity Survey. My work assesses the correlations and causal interpretations between different demographic factors on the likelihood of taking certain actions during a medical emergency. Ordinal logistic regression, data visualization, and qualitative interpretation of respondent feedback serve as the main analytic methods performed. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!
